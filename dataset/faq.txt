1. Why does my washing machine smell?
Nasty odours from washing machines can be caused by several factors, like mould buildup, mildew, or bacteria. 

As your washing machine cleans the dirt, grease, and smells from your clothes, these things build up inside your washer. Add the soap scum and dirty water that get trapped inside the washing machine—the perfect formula for nasty odours.

To remove this egg-like smell, thoroughly wash your washing machine, from the soap dispensers to every crack and crevice, to stop the mould, mildew, and bacteria buildup.

2. Why is my washing machine vibrating harshly?
Washing machines are meant to vibrate and produce sounds when operating their wash and dry cycles. However, if the vibration is too much, it can be distracting and destructive to your appliance. 

If you notice that your washing machine is vibrating too much, check its position to make sure it is level on a flat surface.

3. What is the best way to clean a washing machine?
Your washing machine needs some washing too!

To effectively clean your washing machine and get rid of bacteria and odours, run an empty hot wash cycle with two cups of vinegar. This can prevent the growth of bacteria within your appliance while removing mould and mildew odours.

It’s also important to scrub the exterior of the appliance to remove dust and other stains that stick there. Use a toothbrush to reach every nook and cranny for a 360-degree cleaning.
