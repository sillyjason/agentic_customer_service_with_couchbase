# Agentic Customer Service with Couchbase and LangGraph

Is GenAI utility limited to advanced question answering using RAG? 

Absolutely not. Agentic LLM provides a robust framework to define functions, tools, and give them to LLM so they learn to reason, orchestrate and execute complex workflows without needing human supervision. Pretty much like giving an assistant a well-written Job Description, and leave them to their job.

A predominant use case across industries is customer service - we all need to provide timely, quality, and scalable customer feedbacks, to achieve high customer satisfaction while optimizing business interest, regardless of what we do. 

That’s what we’re building in this demo. When a customer message is received, whoever in charge of handling the ticket would need to perform a series of tasks, including looking up the order and products mentioned, reading product manual, checking company policies... the list goes on, and in any combination or sequences, until it’s deduced that the job is reasonably finished, and finally a reply is sent out. Why not let AI figure out the logics and do it?!

Meanwhile, customer support may well extend beyond question-answering pattern. We’ll also see agentic LLM create tickets, notifications being sent out, data being updated in real-time, and how Couchbase Eventing stitches them together. 

At a high level, this is what happens:

## What Do I Need to Run This Demo? 
1. an OPENAI api key 

2. a LangSmith key for traceability

3. 1 linux virtual machine for hosting the app, and another for installing Couchbase. I'll use AWS EC2 but anything with minimal config will do

<br>

> 🙌🏻 We're using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and installing [Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 7.6](
https://www.couchbase.com). Knowledge of these 2 tools are a plus but not a prerequisite. 

<br><br>


## Setup

**1.1 LLM**
<br>

GPT-4o is used in this demo. You need to have an OPENAI_API_KEY from OpenAI. 

<br>

**1.2 AWS VM**
<br>

>🙌🏻 Use either method below for installation

<br>

**1.2.1 Using Terraform** 
<br>

If you’re a Terraform user, download the /terraform folders from the root directory of this Github repo. Finish the set up of server.tf and run the script.

<br>

**1.2.2 Using AWS Console** 
<br>

Create a virtual machine with the following startup script (I'm using AWS EC2): 
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install git -y
sudo yum install python3 -y
sudo yum install python3-pip -y
git clone https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2
cd chatbot-cb-2
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>

Make sure to update Security Group setting to allow ALL inbound/outbound traffics

<br>

**1.2.3 Get Instance Hostname**
<br>

Let's call this VM our **APP Node**. Note down its Public IPv4 DNS. 

<br>

**1.3 Couchbase Setup**
<br>

Create another VM, install Couchbase with these services enabled: **Data, Query, Index, Search, Eventing**. Make sure the Server version is EE 7.6. If you're new to Couchbase, follow this [link](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/install-linux.html) for more details. 

Let's call this one our **Couchbase Node**. Grab it's IPv4 address too.

<br>

>🙌🏻 In a production set up you'll need at least 3 nodes to run Couchbase for HA purposes. In our case, let's just use 1 node for simplicity.


<br><br>

**1.4 Get, Set, Run!**

<br>

**1.4.1 App node setup**
<br>

SSH into your App node and run the following codes to enter the project location and activate python virtual environment: 
```
sudo -i
cd /
cd chatbot-cb-2
source venv/bin/activate
```

<br>

**1.4.2 .ENV Setup**
<br>

At SSH session, run “nano .env” and fill in these environmental variables:

```
#EE Environment Variables 
EE_HOSTNAME={IPv4 of Couchbase Node}
EVENTING_HOSTNAME={IPv4 of Couchbase Node}
SEARCH_HOSTNAME={IPv4 of Couchbase Node}

#Chatbot Endpoint
CHATBOT_APP_END_POINT={IPv4 of App Node}

#CB User Credential 
CB_USERNAME={username for Couchbase}
CB_PASSWORD= {password for Couchbase}

#LLM Keys 
OPENAI_API_KEY={your OPENAI api key}
```

<br><br>

**1.4.3 Additional Setup**

<br>
Set up bucket/scope/collections

<br>

```
python3 setupbucket.py
```

<br>

Create Eventing functions and FTS indexes.
<br>

```
python3 setupothers.py
```

<br>

>🙌🏻 - Eventing is Couchbase's version of Database Trigger and Lambda functions. It's a versatile and powerful tool to stitch together your data processes and achieve high automation.

>🙌🏻 - FTS is Couchbase's full text and semantic search service. 

<br>

All good. Let's go 
<br>

```
python3 app.py
```



<br><br>

## Demo Process 

<br>

**2.1 AI Data Pipeline**
<br>

We’ll use a series of Eventing functions to simplify the AI data pipeline, which needless to say, is a big challenge for any company looking to build a GenAI application, considering the enormity and complexity of their unstructured data source. Here is what happens with Couchbase


<br>

**Import Data**
<br>

Download the “raw-data.json” file under directory templates/assets/. At “Import” tab under Data Tools, import the file into main.raw.raw collection.  

<img width="1427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/ba300a13-3c98-4861-b410-3e5c52ad6a16">

<br><br>


>🙌🏻 It’s worth pointing out the steps this raw data must go through before it’s RAG ready:
>- Data format inconsistency. For example, “last_upddate” field
>- Empty spaces. For example, “content” field
>- Data of different nature (2 product JSON and 1 email regarding internal policy JSON)
>- Sensitive data. For example, ID or email in “content” field (in real time scenarios this should be done with a local model. In our case for the light-weight-ness of the app we're running with REST call instead.)

<br>

After import, go to main.raw.raw collection to check data successfully imported;

<br>

<img width="1111" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/3174a8f5-ba92-4232-8dcc-435b117b8165">

<br>

Then, go to main.raw.formatted collection. Data reformatting, masking, and labelling are already applied automatically.

<br>

<img width="1144" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/50808ee0-b6a5-4c97-a4f7-0bbf02e094ab">

<br>

Click to open the document that looks like *"content": "Dear Tony....* You’ll notice the format inconsistency, empty space, and sensitive data issues are taken care of

<br>

<img width="670" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/090e2f82-3b9f-47bf-aefb-ac9a269f31cb">

<br>
<br>

>🙌🏻 note that in this demo, the sensitive data masking is done by prompting OPENAI with a API call. In production this defeats the purpose of data protection and instead, the model should be deployed locally hence local inferencing, a totally viable approach) 

<br>

Also note, every doc is added a “type” field which is an enumeration of [“internal_policies”, “insurance_product”]

<br>

<img width="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/83543e6a-953f-4756-b1b1-c52e77b35573">

<br>

Go to scope “data”. The 3 raw JSON objects are now pigeonholed into corresponding collections, automatically. Also note embedding is added. 

<br>

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/113e5053-0704-4a21-92b9-eafa53c2212a">


<br>

## Now let’s do some chatbot’ing  
<br>


**2.2 Chatbot**

<br>

Open your browser, access the chatbot via port 5000:  *{IPv4 of App Node}:5000*

<br>

<img width="1403" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/9977a53b-2d8b-445b-b1dd-b4d8f02ecdec">

<br><br>

Take a look at the raw data, and feel free to ask any questions. 

<br><br>

<br><br>

Also note there are elements of user engagements. Feel free to give ratings to the comments.

<br><br>


At this moment we’ve demoed how Couchbase acts as both vector store and AI data pipeline orchestration platform. But we can demo more. 

<br><br>

**2.3 Agile Development, Simplified Query, etc.**
<br>

>🙌🏻 At this stage we've seen Couchbase making possible a RAG solution plus automated data processing. Let's see more.
 
<br>

**2.3.1 NoSQL Flexibility**
<br>

What if in quick iteration, customer needs to update their schema? In our example, collection main.chats.human has the field “user_id”, but not main.chats.bot. If it’s decided that the field be added to the ‘bot’ collection too, just to go Query tab and run the following: 

<br>

<img width="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/19203a25-7971-497c-ab43-4c78deac6431">


```
UPDATE main.chats.bot AS b
SET b.user_id = (SELECT RAW d.user_id FROM main.chats.human AS d WHERE meta().id = b.user_msg_id)[0]
WHERE b.user_msg_id IS NOT NULL;
```

<br>

Go back to collection main.chats.bots. Note the user_id field is already created. In a RDMNS database, this would be much harder.

<br>

<img width="635" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sillyjason/chatbot-cb-2/assets/54433200/3b5f0ccd-b33e-4f3c-b5fd-b4b39f68846e">

<br>


>🙌🏻 The query might fail with “index not created” message. In this case, follow Index Advisor to create index and re-run the query
Easy. This is good time to explain the superiority of NoSQL when fast iteration is required.

<br>


<br><br>

**2.3.2 SQL JOIN**
<br>

If customer choose to have a separate vector database, they’ll end up storing vectors, transactions, and SQL docs in separate datastore. Imagine running query that needs joining these disconnected tables. 
With Couchbase, easy. Go to Query service and run the following query:
```
SELECT p, COUNT(*) AS frequency, pr.product_name
FROM `main`.`chats`.`bot` AS b
UNNEST b.product_ids AS p
JOIN `main`.`data`.`products` AS pr ON KEYS p
GROUP BY p, pr.product_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```
